# User Management Application

This is a simple Angular application for user management with features like signup, admin approval, login with temporary keys, CRUD operations, and data persistence.

## Default Admin Info

- **Email:** admin@gmail.com
- **Password:** test123@gmail.com (ideally shouldn't be explicitly mentioned for security reasons)

## What Was Achieved

- Implemented a signup form using Angular.
- Implemented a login form using Angular.
- Implemented a dashboard using Angular.
- Submitted user information to a mocked REST API.
- Displayed users on the dashboard view.
- Implemented admin approval process and generated temporary keys.
- Allowed users to log in using temporary keys.
- Temporarily persisted data based on the current session using LocalStorage.
- Demonstrated API calls to a mocked REST API.

## Issues Encountered

- With regards to the implementation, no major issues were encountered. If you face any problems, please refer to the documentation or seek assistance.

- Other unforseen circumstances arose, hence hindering the completion of the work.

## Additional Details

- Please note that this is a simplified demonstration, and in a real-world scenario, I would implement more secure authentication methods and error handling.
- Ensure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed before running the application.
- Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
- Use `ng serve` to run the development server and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser.
